To create a new console application, run:

        Make MyProject v0.1.0

```

As the output shows, the [new.md](../commands/new.md "mention") command automatically runs <mark style="color:green;">`make`</mark>. Let's see what the package looks like:

```
$ cd MyProject
$ tree .
.
├── Package.toml
├── Package.lock
├── BeefSpace.toml
├── BeefProj.toml
└── src
    └── Program.bf
```

<mark style="color:yellow;">`Package.toml`</mark> is the package manifest. Here you can specify properties about your package, such as name, version and dependencies. The dependencies table is not included in newly created manifests, but can be added like this:

```toml
[Package]
Name = "MyProject"
Version = "0.1.0"
Description = ""

[Dependencies]
Lib = "1.2.3"
```

<mark style="color:yellow;">`Package.lock`</mark> is generated by Grill and should not be edited manually.

The other files make up a Beef workspace that can be opened and debugged in the IDE.
