# Initializing an existing project

To initialize an existing project, make sure your main project is at the root of your package. To add the necessary files for a Grill package, run:

```
$ grill init
```

You can use the [make.md](../commands/make.md "mention") command to generate the workspace.

> **Note:** Generating a new workspace will remove any dependencies _not ****_ listed in the manifest. Remember to add your dependencies to the manifest before you run the <mark style="color:green;">`make`</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;"></mark> command.
