# Introduction

Grill is a package manager for the [Beef Programming Language](https://www.beeflang.org/).

Grill takes care of dependency resolution, fetching and workspace generation. This way, complex workspaces and dependency trees can be managed by a few commands.

### PLEASE NOTE

I am at the moment rewriting Grill from Rust to Beef, so everything has not been implemented yet, but pages will be updated accordingly. Unimplemented items are labeled in the page description (right under the title).

All items listed in this documentation are ony the roadmap, already implemented in legacy grill.
